This project focuses on the development of a comprehensive Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) solution to monitor and manage corporate performance across multiple business units. By integrating six years of historical budget and actual data (2019-2024), this dashboard provides executive-level visibility into revenue gaps and operational efficiency.

The core objective was to transform static Excel reporting into a dynamic, automated environment that identifies financial risks (Bowler-style) and opportunities for cost savings.

Revenue Management: Monitored a total Income Actual of $6.91M, identifying a slight -2.76% variance compared to the $7.10M budget.

Operational Efficiency: Successfully tracked an Expense Actual of $2.25M, achieving a 7.67% reduction in spending against a $2.44M budget—highlighting effective cost control.

Variance Benchmarking: Built a detailed matrix to track performance by Project ID (1050-1054), using conditional formatting to signal critical variances, such as the +12.78% growth in Project 1050 during 2024.

Data Modeling: Implemented a Star Schema to handle multi-year financial records efficiently.

Advanced DAX: Developed custom measures for Dynamic Variances, Cumulative Performance, and Status Indicators.

UX/UI Design: Applied the Ayala’s Consulting brand identity, featuring a high-contrast dark-mode navigation and intuitive KPI cards for executive review.

Interactive Analytics: Integrated cross-filtering for Year, Month, and Project ID to allow for seamless drill-down from annual totals to specific operational units.
